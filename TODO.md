* Use jest + puppeteer for testing
* Ideally people could run tests and point them to a local build of preact
* Perhaps test watch files and rerun on file change (e.g. local build of preact)
* Webpack should re-bundle when preact changes 
* Should be able to specify which integration tests to run
	* Should utilize jest's built-in feature if each library has its own test file)
* Add "Open in Sandbox" button using [CodeSandbox define api](https://codesandbox.io/docs/importing#define-api)
