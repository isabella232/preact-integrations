Might need to bundle direct and compat with different webpack configs
Need to setup some sort of dev server
Should we use karmatic or puppeteer for testing
Ideally people could run tests and point them to a local build of preact
Perhaps test watch files and rerun on file change (e.g. local build of preact)
Webpack should re-bundle when preact changes 
Should be able to specify which integration tests to run
