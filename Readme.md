# Preact Integrations

A collection of sample apps demonstrating Preact's compatibility with various 3rd party libraries

---

## Description

This repo exports a collection of simple Preact apps that demonstrate how to use preact with various 3rd party libraries including `react-redux`, `mobx-react`, `react-router`, and more!

The apps are divided into 2 categories: raw and compat. Libraries in the "raw" directory can be used with `preact` directly and don't require `preact/compat`. Libraries in the "compat" directory require using `preact/compat`.
